## 📃 Description
/dev/log is a tech blogging website containing posts about various technology-related topics such as online privacy, cybersecurity, networking, Linux, and more, with a mix of tutorials and informational posts. The website currently allows users to create an account, browse through posts shared by other users, and create, update, or delete their own posts.

## 🔍 Background Information
I am creating this project as part of my studies at General Assembly's software engineering bootcamp.

The reason I chose to create a tech blog as my project is simply because I've always been interested in the idea of starting my own blog, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to give it a shot while also sharpening my full-stack development skills at the same time.
