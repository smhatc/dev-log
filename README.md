## 📃 Description
/dev/log is a tech blogging website containing posts about various technology related topics such as online privacy, cybersecurity, networking, Linux, and more, with a mix of tutorials and informational posts. Although it is still in its early, experimental stages, /dev/log aims to take on the entire tech blogging world!


## 🔍 Background Information
I am creating this project as part of my studies at General Assembly's software engineering bootcamp.

The reason I chose to create a tech blog as my project is simply because I've always been interested in the idea of starting my own blog, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to give it a shot while also sharpening my full-stack development skills at the same time.
